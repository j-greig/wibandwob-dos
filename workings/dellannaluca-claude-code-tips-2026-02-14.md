5 ADVANCED CLAUDE CODE TIPS I'VE BEEN USING

1) Self-improvement injection
“Create a UserPromptSubmit hook (global settings). Script echoes: If 8+ tool calls, append one optimization hint (reusable skill, memory pattern, or workflow fix). One sentence. Skip if exploratory.”"


2) Skills audit
"Create a skill that lists all my installed skills (project & global level) with their line counts. Then ask the user which to review for improvement opportunities (conciseness, clarity, overlapping scopes, token efficiency).”


3) Claude audit
“Create a skill that reads all CLAUDE .md files and checks for: redundant instructions, verbose phrasing, and content that could move to memory. Present findings and ask if the user wants to implement them.”


4) Reflect
"Create a skill that reviews the current conversation, analyzes tasks, errors, and user feedback, and extracts opportunities for learning, skill creation, and skill improvement; then, presents the findings to the user and asks what to implement or write to memory.


5) Conditional prompt linter
“Create a UserPromptSubmit hook in global settings. The script counts words and, if >50, echoes a note asking Claude to check if the desired outcome is clear. The output gets appended to the prompt.”
