# Thread Memory Refresh

## Packed one-paragraph summary
Conversation starts Turbo Vision + Turbo Pascal + tvision port + desire to refactor WibWob-DOS into agent-native OS; initial focus parity between menu, IPC, API/MCP; move toward command/capability registry as single source of truth; engine authoritative, UI optional, headless mode, contracts versioned; propose canonical repo tree, then refine it; introduce instances abstraction for local + hosted futures; introduce containerized runtime artifact + Docker path; multi-agent coexistence, actor attribution, visible event bus, heartbeat loops; integrate HedgyOS ideas: encrypted per-instance vault filesystem, assistant as first-class actor, event panel as cognition surface; deep dive Turbo Vision mental model, preserve message loop + streaming object graph + command IDs; build and refine a canonical refactor prompt to drive refactor agents; add PR checklist + CI enforcement for append-only + contract discipline; shift focus to local-first knowledge systems, Obsidian/Logseq/Zettelkasten, local-first only, vault as durable cognitive substrate; define Vault-as-Memory-Substrate model + instance directory layout; design single Markdown oslog with frontmatter + NDJSON events + reflections; define append-only event NDJSON + snapshot JSON roundtrip; emphasize engine ephemeral vs vault durable; derive graph from files, never canonicalize graph; multi-agent co-authoring rules, append-only to avoid conflicts; encryption models: full-vault vs envelope, prefer container-level encryption with human-readable vault; migration strategy from current repo to vault+event architecture; CI + schema validation + snapshot determinism tests; meta-prompt for future adaptive architectural prompts; end state: canonical agent-native Turbo Vision OS with container runtime, web viewer option, multi-agent windows, append-only vault-backed memory, contract-driven core.

## Headline (20 words)
Refactor WibWob-DOS into a contract-driven, append-only, local-first, multi-agent Turbo Vision OS with vault memory, containers, and web observability.
