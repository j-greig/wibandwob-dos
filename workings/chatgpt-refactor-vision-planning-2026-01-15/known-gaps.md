# Known Gaps and Non-Artifact Outputs

This file tracks items requested in the thread that were acknowledged but not delivered as explicit standalone artifacts in the conversation output itself.

## Requested but not explicitly emitted in-thread as full docs
- "Phase Zero Canon Alignment" sequence as a standalone detailed document.
- "Symbient OS Manifesto" full template as a standalone document.

## Current status in this bundle
- These ideas are represented indirectly in prompts/spec summaries, but not as dedicated long-form source documents from the original thread.

## If you want to close these gaps next
- Create `phase-zero-canon-alignment.md` from the execution roadmap sections in:
  - `workings/chatgpt-refactor-vision-planning-2026-01-15/prompts/refactor-prompt-2026-02-15.md`
  - `workings/chatgpt-refactor-vision-planning-2026-01-15/prompts/execution-prompts.md`
- Create `symbient-os-manifesto-template.md` from philosophy sections in:
  - `workings/readme-research.md`
  - `workings/chatgpt-refactor-vision-planning-2026-01-15/thread-memory-refresh.md`
