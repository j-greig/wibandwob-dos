# Ranked Research Prompts Backlog (Extracted)

## Tier 1 (highest leverage)
1. Event-sourcing + visible cognition architectures.
2. Cognitive architecture / extended mind models for human-AI co-agency.
3. Filesystem-as-memory substrate (Obsidian/Logseq/local-first patterns).
4. Agent runtime isolation + capability security.
5. Turbo Vision streaming/object-graph persistence vs modern serialization.

## Tier 2 (major differentiators)
6. Multi-agent conversational topologies and actor presence semantics.
7. Generative interface DSLs for TUI components.
8. Live coding / reflexive systems patterns.
9. Narrative and performative OS design patterns.

## Tier 3 (left-field but high-value)
10. OS messaging lineage (Xerox/NeXT/BeOS/Plan9) and lessons for WibWob.
11. ECS vs object-tree hybrids for window/component architecture.
12. Cognitive load and terminal UX ergonomics.
13. Time-as-first-class UX (timeline/replay/time-travel design).
14. Distributed identity for agents across instances.
15. Long-term human-AI attachment and continuity design.

## Focus selected in-thread
- Deep dive executed on #3 (local-first memory substrate) with local-first scope.
