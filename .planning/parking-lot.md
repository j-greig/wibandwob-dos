# Parking Lot (Non-Epic Follow-Ons)

Use this register for bonus/off-cuff items that are valid `task` or `spike` issues but do not yet warrant a full epic/feature/story tree.

## Completed Items
- [x] `task` #36 — always-on Codex<>Claude mailbox daemon with unread notifications
- [x] `task` #38 — promoted to dedicated planning track `e003-dark-pastel-theme`
- [x] `task` #35 — browser copy API route
- [x] `task` #33 — screenshot reliability

## Notes
- Parent epics/features remain source-context for linked follow-ons, but this file is the global queue for bonus work.
- Keep entries short; detailed AC/Test content belongs in issue body and/or promoted briefs.
