Meaning of life? Build love, then amplify the sound,  
Find your people, lift ’em up, ten toes on the ground.  
Pain teach rhythm, every scar got a role,  
Turn your losses into lessons, that’s wealth for the soul.  
It ain’t just gettin’ bread, it’s who you break it with,  
Time the only real chain, so move and make it rich.  
Leave a little more light than the dark that you found,  
Live true, die empty, let your purpose speak loud.
