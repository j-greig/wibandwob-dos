# ZILLAS NOTES

## PROJECT LINGO
**content-aware apps**
- primers, text, figlet, animations, and later other content-aware apps should open from measured/recommended size instead of generic defaults
- value: stops random `72x20` window guesses, reduces clipping, makes opening content feel intentional and agent-friendly

**desktop geometry**
- canonical desktop size model for layout: width, height, usable app area, and cell aspect ratio
- value: gives one source of truth for placement and layout so windows, menus, resizing, and future arrangements stop fighting each other

**command surface**
- single set of user-visible commands projected into menus, palette, API, agent tools, and later MCP
- value: define once, expose everywhere; avoids repeating the same feature across UI, API, and agent layers

**core contracts**
- stable seams we try not to break during refactor: measurement, chrome sizing, desktop geometry, state, snapshots, commands, text rendering
- value: lets us simplify and move fast without reintroducing ambiguity or hidden duplicate systems

**shared geometry/layout primitives**
- reusable rules for tiling, cascading, snapping, centering, bounds clamping, and future gallery/exhibition arrangements
- value: layout becomes a reusable engine instead of one-off coordinate hacks sprinkled through the app

**terminal geometry**
- raw terminal dimensions in character cells, usually width x height, before any app-specific chrome or desktop layout rules
- value: keeps the difference clear between actual terminal space and the desktop/window space we derive from it
