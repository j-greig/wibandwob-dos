# Symbient OS Manifesto Template

## Identity

- Instance name:
- Primary actor(s):
- Purpose:

## Principles

1. Local-first memory and operation.
2. Canonical command/capability source with parity across interfaces.
3. Append-only event discipline with actor attribution.
4. Deterministic, portable state snapshots.
5. Replaceable engine, durable human-readable artifacts.

## Operating Commitments

- We define commands once and derive external surfaces from that source.
- We treat parity drift as a test failure, not a documentation issue.
- We preserve backward compatibility unless explicitly declared breaking.
- We prefer small, reversible, test-backed changes.

## Event and Memory Ethos

- Every state mutation is attributable.
- Logs and snapshots are auditable and understandable by humans.
- Tooling must never lock memory into opaque formats.
